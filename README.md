Documenting what I do for advent this year (2022) since I forgot to last year.

Focusing on being more comfortable with Rust. Some notes below to help me for later when I inevitably forget and close all of my Rust-related tabs.

To run after pulling this code:
- Go to the directory that you want to see
- Run `cargo run -- <command line arguments>`

To make a new project
- Go to root directory of this repo
- Run `cargo new day<what-day-is-it>`
